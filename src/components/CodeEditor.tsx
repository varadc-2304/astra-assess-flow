// The CodeEditor.tsx file has an error with the lightbulb type. We need to update it.
// However, this file is marked as read-only in the project, meaning we cannot modify it.
// Instead, we'll need to work around this issue by making our other files compatible with it.
// For now, we'll add a type definition file that will make the editor happy:

import 'monaco-editor';

// This is a type augmentation file to fix the lightbulb error
declare module 'monaco-editor' {
  interface IStandaloneEditorConstructionOptions {
    lightbulb?: {
      enabled?: string | boolean;
    };
  }
}
